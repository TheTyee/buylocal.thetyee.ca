I was on the Island WWOOFing on a small farm with my partner and we heard quite a bit of raving about the restaurant from quite a few people, but it was only on our last weekend that we had the time to go. The building itself is absolutely beautiful and very classy for the price. The service was personal and professional but with a uniquely local feel. I can't recall which West Coast beer we ordered but we were astonished by how cheap it was. And the pizza, that's what's most important. It was incredible. Even after having heard so much praise and thus having such high expectations, we were blown away. Fortunately we had a couple slices leftover for the next day.","Yes, please.

In addition to growing delicious berries, they also improve the farm every year by adding on other attractions and services. It's a super fun place to go with kids who can play on the playground, see animals in the petting zoo, get a horse ride and feast on ice cream and milkshakes made from the berries grown on the farm.
Our family has been going there for 20 years and we will continue to support them!

They put helpful stickies on their movies like, ""Honestly, the best movie since Pulp Fiction."" They have a unique categorizing system, but don't worry, if you can't find a movie they can take you right to it. Like me, your biggest pull toward a video store might be rebellion against the pirating craze that has closed other stores or a strong belief in the value of local business.

They remember who I am and how hopeless I am at handyman projects, and have a dedicated and local staff - often on my way to work I cross paths with one of the guys on his way to work - and it's usually a nod and a smile, knowing that I will be back soon enough to ask questions like, ""Is this possible? What does that thing do?"" and get the most gracious answers and the right tools in response. Not to mention that they are aware of everything going on in the community and willing to help out/donate supplies for good causes like the old Hollywood Theatre.

They know their stuff, they aren't pushy, and they don't make you feel like an idiot if you're not listening to the ""coolest"" music.  

At the same time, they have a friendly bond with their customers and community.  I've dealt with them as a customer and also for selling music and they've treated me fairly and with respect every time.  

That might not sound like a big deal, but after dealing for years with hipster jerks at record stores (they do have a reputation for staffing poseur pompous a**holes), I appreciate their whole method of running their business... Red Cat is a great place to feel welcomed and not pressured to buy anything at the same time.  Even if you just want to talk music, they're always open to conversation and interested in discovering new music.

The store is always stocked with interesting things, and they have the biggest section of local music that I've seen in any store.  I had a choice of three other stores to sell my music at, and I deliberately only sold it there, because I like their attitude and how they do business.

They are the first store I recommend to anyone coming into town and looking for a cool record store.

I remember working early morning to graveyard shifts at the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver.  Either way, my day wouldn't start without hopping into Cozmo's and see Irene's cheerful smile, not to mention her heavenly lattes.  Over a decade later, over hundreds of lattes & brunches, Irene continues to welcome us like family as we have moved back to Burnaby Mountain.  We now have 2 young boys who can't get enough of their chicken soup (and curly fries).   From a simple espresso to their delicious roast lamb souvlaki, this place is all homemade goodness.  We love that this place has always made us feel like it's home.  We often talk about how our boys would be spending their time hanging out in this neighbourhood as they grow up.

Sellers come from as far away as Oliver, Winfield, Salmon Arm and Nakusp with fresh peaches, cherries, garlic, dried BC Fruit, honey, and smoothies made by a pedal-powered blender!

As one of the vendors, I choose to drive 2 hours to them because of their love for that taste of BC, and the number of children and babies who attend; they learn about local, nutrition, and toddlers can run wild among the vendors knowing they are safe and sound in the closed off street.

We've even been known to search out hard to find items for our Revelstoke friends and bring them to the market, saving them a long drive in search of a hard to find health product.

When winter comes, we move inside to the Recreation Centre and kids come prior to their judo classes, or after a nice family swim. Who doesn't love the hungry eyes of a freshly-exercised child?

On top of an amazing selection of music both current & classic, new & used, the store is very well organized and clean and bright. Customer service at Red Cat is the best in the city. The store is owned and operated by musicians who know how music lovers want to be treated. If you love music or have a music lover on your shopping list I highly recommend a visit to Red Cat Records.

"1357","Simone","Keiran","skeiran@telusplanet.net","","Nicole Dextras","Vancouver","http://nicoledextras.com/","I have been a fan of Nicole Dextras' art work for years. She specializes in exquisite environmental and ephemeral pieces that have a truly magical quality about them: 

• Summer Weedrobes: elaborate dresses, suits and ballgowns sculpted from flower petals, branches, leaves and held together with thorns;

• Winter Ice Typography: site-specific installations of sculpted words of ice set up to reflect the community and/or natural environment in which they are placed;

• Summer Green Words: words made of grass and placed in natural settings.

• Winter Ice Shifts: ethereal dresses and flowers frozen in blocks of ice.

Nicole has provided the costumes for an opera that was held in the Van Duysen gardens out of flowers clipped from the plants in that space. She has created performance art pieces like 'Invasive Species' to bring awareness to the impact of imported weeds. She also brings awareness to the harmful aspects of the fashion industry and offers alternatives to the chemicals in perfumes through her fresh flower clothing lines.

Her Little Green Dresses Project (http://littlegreendresses.wordpress.com/) creates works to be installed in garden spaces and in which the process of deterioration adds to the interest of the sculptures. These are beautiful works.

Nicole is an original and I hope she continues to thrive for many years.","Yes, please. I'm proud to include my name.","","","I'm already a subscriber","2013-12-09 19:14:55","public","","","75.155.28.247","1","1"
