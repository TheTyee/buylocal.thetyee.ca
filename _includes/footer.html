				<h2 class="partner-heading">The Tyee</h2>
				<p>In November 2003, The Tyee began its swim upstream against the media trends of our day. We're independent and not owned by any big corporation, and based in Vancouver, BC. We're dedicated to publishing lively, informative news and views, not dumbed down fluff. We, like the tyee salmon for which we're named, roam free and go where we wish.</p>
				<p>Eleven years later?  We've helped revive old-style, long-form reporting and shed light on the stories and solutions big media ignores. Our writers are some of the best in the country. Together, we've broken major stories and won major awards. The Tyee is now a widely read and respected platform for the forward-thinking, fact-based conversation our province and country desperately need to have. </p>
